I am a spatial economist whose research agenda lies on the intersection between macroeconomics and international trade; I describe it as “Spatial Macroeconomics and Dynamic Trade.” I am embedding the dynamics of growth emphasized in macroeconomics into canonical trade models and incorporating the spatial dimension emphasized in trade models into macroeconomics. In my empirical work, I combine well-identified partial equilibrium effects using spatial data to inform estimates of general equilibrium effects. I use spatial data to answer questions about growth, trade, and inequality.
