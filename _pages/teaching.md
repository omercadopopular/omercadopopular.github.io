# Long Run Macroeconomics, Econ 110A, Undergraduate (Growth)

I was the Instructor of UCSD's Summer Session II First Sequence of Intermediate Macroeconomics. The course covers Long Run Macroeconomics (Growth) and follows Chad Jones' Macroeconomics textbook. My teaching material was largely based on Giacomo Rondina's slides, who was my supervising faculty for this course.

1. [Intro & the Neoclassical Growth Model](https://github.com/omercadopopular/omercadopopular.github.io/blob/master/files/econ110a/Lecture%201.pdf)
2. [Measuring the Economy](https://github.com/omercadopopular/omercadopopular.github.io/blob/master/files/econ110a/Lecture%202.pdf )
3. [Long Run Growth: Facts](https://github.com/omercadopopular/omercadopopular.github.io/blob/master/files/econ110a/Lecture%203.pdf)

# Graduate Macroeconomics, Econ 210A, TA Session Discussion Notes (Growth)

I was the Teaching Assistant of UCSD's PhD First Year macro sequence. Below I publish the notes I have used for the discussion session with first years.
They tend to be very detailed in algebraic derivations, since the objective is to make them easily comprehensible by students who are facing this material for the first
time. Use them at your own risk.

1. [Fundamentals of Value Function Iteration](https://github.com/omercadopopular/omercadopopular.github.io/blob/master/files/phdta/1.%20Fundamentals%20of%20VFI.pdf)
2. [Analytical and Numerical Solutions to VFI](https://github.com/omercadopopular/omercadopopular.github.io/blob/master/files/phdta/2.%20Analytical%20and%20Numerical%20Solutions%20to%20VFI.pdf) 
3. [Inefficient Equilibria - Economy with Externalities](https://github.com/omercadopopular/omercadopopular.github.io/blob/master/files/phdta/3.%20Inefficient%20Equilibria%20-%20Economy%20with%20Externalities.pdf)

# Introduction to Statistics and Probability with Python (in Portuguese)

I taught "Introduction to Stats and Probability with Python" at Institute for Higher Education of Brasília (IESB), a private university in Brasília, Brazil. This class was part of a graduate degree in Data Science and was meant to cover basic principles of statistics and statistical programming.

2. [Data Types (Time Series, Panel Data, Cross-Section); Descriptive Statistics; Introduction to pandas.](https://github.com/omercadopopular/cgoes/blob/master/StatsPython/slides/Aula%202.pdf)
3. [Intro do Data Visualization; Intro to matplotlib and seaborn](https://github.com/omercadopopular/cgoes/blob/master/StatsPython/slides/Aula%203.pdf)
4. [Mean, Median, Mode, Quantiles and Standard Deviation](https://github.com/omercadopopular/cgoes/blob/master/StatsPython/slides/Aula%204.pdf)
5. No slides (review before midterm)
6. [Functions, Probability, Density Functions, Z-scores](https://github.com/omercadopopular/cgoes/blob/master/StatsPython/slides/Aula%206.pdf)
7. [Central limit theorem, standard errors and confidence intervals](https://github.com/omercadopopular/cgoes/blob/master/StatsPython/slides/Aula%207.pdf)
8. [Hypothesis testing, t-statistics, p-value](https://github.com/omercadopopular/cgoes/blob/master/StatsPython/slides/Aula%208.pdf)
