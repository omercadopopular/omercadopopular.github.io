# International Trade Theory and Policy, Econ 2181, Undergraduate (George Washington University)

I teach international trade to GWU's undergraduate students. The course covers the following models: Classic Ricardian Model (two countries, two goods); Ricardian Trade with Multiple Goods (two countries, many goods); Specific Factors Model; Hecksher-Ohlin Model; Krugman Model; Melitz Model. It loosely follows the textbook International Economics by Krugman, Obstfeld, & Melitz; but it includes handouts that go deeper into the derivations of the model. My teaching material was somewhat based on slides by  [Marc Muendler](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/muendler/html/teach.html) (UCSD, who was my PhD advisor); [Treb Allen](https://sites.google.com/site/treballen/undergraduate-trade?authuser=0) (Dartmouth College); and [Dave Donaldson](https://dave-donaldson.com/2018-fall-international-economics-mit-14-581/) (MIT) .

# Long Run Macroeconomics, Econ 110A, Undergraduate (UC San Diego)

I taught intermediate macroeconomics while I was a PhD Candidate at UC San Diego. The course covers Long Run Macroeconomics (Growth) and follows Chad Jones' Macroeconomics textbook. My teaching material was somewhat based on [Giacomo Rondina](https://giacomorondina.org/)'s slides, who was the supervising faculty for this course.

# Graduate Macroeconomics, Econ 210A, TA Session Discussion Notes (UC San Diego)

I was the Teaching Assistant of UCSD's PhD First Year macro sequence for three years. Below I publish the notes I have used for the discussion session with first years. They tend to be very detailed in algebraic derivations, since the objective is to make them easily comprehensible by students who are facing this material for the first
time.
