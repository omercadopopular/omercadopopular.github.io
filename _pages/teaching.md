# Long Run Macroeconomics, Econ 110A, Undergraduate (Growth)

I was the Instructor of UCSD's Summer Session II First Sequence of Intermediate Macroeconomics. The course covers Long Run Macroeconomics (Growth) and follows Chad Jones' Macroeconomics textbook. My teaching material was somewhat based on Giacomo Rondina's slides, who was the supervising faculty for this course.

# Graduate Macroeconomics, Econ 210A, TA Session Discussion Notes (Growth)

I was the Teaching Assistant of UCSD's PhD First Year macro sequence. Below I publish the notes I have used for the discussion session with first years.
They tend to be very detailed in algebraic derivations, since the objective is to make them easily comprehensible by students who are facing this material for the first
time. Use them at your own risk.

# Introduction to Statistics and Probability with Python (in Portuguese)
