# Graduate Macroeconomics (TA Session Discussion Notes)

I was the Teaching Assistant of UCSD's PhD First Year macro sequence. Below I publish the notes I have used for the discussion session with first years.
They tend to be very detailed in algebraic derivations, since the objective is to make them easily comprehensible by students who are facing this material for the first
time. Use them at your own risk.
